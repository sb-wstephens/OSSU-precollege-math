# Summary

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in pre-college math** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in fundamental concepts
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

The courses are specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles
- Match the [curricular standards](CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md)

When there are courses or books that don’t fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality, they belong in [extras/courses](/extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](/extras/readings.md).

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some extra courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups. Each course has a prerequisite of the previous course, so they should be done in a linear order top to bottom.

**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Respect the code of conduct* that you signed in the beginning of each course!

# Curriculum

Many OSSU students choose to review math topics that they have not studied recently.
OSSU recommends using [The College Prep School](https://www.youtube.com/@thecollegeprepschool4486/playlists) for such a review.
To determine where you should start, we recommend scanning through the Final Tests for anything you may be uncomfortable with. After taking an assessment, you should have a clear idea of what topics to study and where you should start with the resources below.

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites | Assessments
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:
[ ][Arithmetic](/coursepages/arithmetic/README.md) | 20 Weeks | 8 hours/week | None | [Final Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af-MqCJGZww&list=PLm2VEQtiYjhpTTgxTVCXVcpYWDUqiewiQ&index=39&pp=iAQB0gcJCTgDd0p55Nqk)

When going through the playlists, it's important to pause the video and complete most of the problems yourself. You don't have to complete all the problems since a few are used to demonstrate the solving technique, but try to complete as many as possible.
Practice what you have not mastered by:
1. Googling and/or searching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) for another POV on the topic or more practice problems, working through the examples with them. [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@khanacademy), [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor), & [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard) are great resources for this.
2. Asking for help in #prerequisite-math on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mS4GnBCdZk).

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you have completed all the prerequisite math necessary to begin a bachelor's degree.
Congratulations!

What is next for you? You can start with the OSSU [Computer Science](https://cs.ossu.dev), [Data Science](https://ds.ossu.dev), or [Math](https://math.ossu.dev/) curriculum.

## How to show your progress

[Fork](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fork-a-github-repository/) the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossu/precollege-math) into your own GitHub account and put ✅ next to the stuff you've completed as you complete it. This can serve as your [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) and will be faster to implement than any other solution (giving you time to spend on the courses).
